Wildcards
=========

:boldcode:`* and ?`
---------------------

The character ``*`` is called a wildcard, and will match against one or more character(s) in a file (or directory) name. For example, in your unixstuff directory, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls list*

This will list all files in the current directory starting with list....

Try typing

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls *list

This will list all files in the current directory ending with ....list

The character ``?`` will match exactly one character.
So ls ?ouse will match files like **house** and **mouse**, but not **grouse**.
Try typing

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls ?list

Filename conventions
====================

We should note here that a directory is merely a special type of file. So the rules and conventions for naming files apply also to directories.

In naming files, characters with special meanings such as ``/ * & % ,`` should be avoided. Also, avoid using spaces within names. The safest way to name a file is to use only alphanumeric characters, that is, letters and numbers, together with ``_`` (underscore) and ``.`` (dot).

File names conventionally start with a lower-case letter, and may end with a dot followed by a group of letters indicating the contents of the file. For example, all files consisting of C code may be named with the ending .c, for example, prog1.c . Then in order to list all files containing C code in your home directory, you need only type ls ``*.c`` in that directory.

.. note::

   some applications give the same name to all the output files they generate.

   For example, some compilers, unless given the appropriate option, produce compiled files named ``a.out``. Should you forget to use that option, you are advised to rename the compiled file immediately, otherwise the next such file will overwrite it and it will be lost.

Getting help
============

Online manuals
--------------

There are on-line manuals which gives information about most commands. The manual pages tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behavior of the command. Type man command to read the manual page for a particular command.

For example, to find out more about the ``wc`` (word count) command, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ man wc

Alternatively,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ whatis wc

gives a one-line description of the command, but omits any information about options etc.

Apropos
-------

When you are not sure of the exact name of a command,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apropos keyword

will give you the commands with keyword in their manual page header. For example, try typing

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apropos copy

Shortcut
========

You've learned quite a lot over the course of the last pages. The remainder is very technical and frankly not that relevant. If you like, you can take a shortcut and continue with the Gromacs tutorial :ref:`gromacs-tutorial-label`.
