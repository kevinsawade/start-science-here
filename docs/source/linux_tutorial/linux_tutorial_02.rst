Redirection
===========

Most processes initiated by UNIX commands write to the standard output (that is, they write to the terminal screen), and many take their input from the standard input (that is, they read it from the keyboard). There is also the standard error, where processes write their error messages, by default, to the terminal screen.

We have already seen one use of the ``cat`` command to write the contents of a file to the screen.

Now type ``cat`` without specifying a file to read

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat

Then type a few words on the keyboard and press the :boldcode:`[Return]` key.

Finally hold the :boldcode:`[Ctrl]` key down and press :boldcode:`[d]` (written as ``^D`` for short) to end the input.

What has happened?

If you run the ``cat`` command without specifying a file to read, it reads the standard input (the keyboard), and on receiving the'end of file' (^D), copies it to the standard output (the screen).

In UNIX, we can redirect both the input and the output of commands.

Redirecting the Output
======================

We use the ``>`` symbol to redirect the output of a command. For example, to create a file called **list1** containing a list of fruit, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat > list1

Then type in the names of some fruit. Press [Return] after each one.

.. code-block::

   pear
   banana
   apple
   ^D (Control D to stop)

What happens is the ``cat`` command reads the standard input (the keyboard) and the ``>`` redirects the output, which normally goes to the screen, into a file called **list1**.

To read the contents of the file, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat list1

.. sshexercise:: Exercise 2a

   Using the above method, create another file called **list2** containing the following fruit: orange, plum, mango, grapefruit. Read the contents of **list2**

   The form ``>>`` appends standard output to a file (in contrast to a single ``>`` which will **overwrite** a file). So to add more items to the file list1, type

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cat >> list1

   Then type in the names of more fruit

   .. code-block::

      peach
      grape
      orange
      ^D (Control D to stop)

   To read the contents of the file, type

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cat list1

   You should now have two files. One contains six fruit, the other contains four fruit. We will now use the ``cat`` command to join (concatenate) **list1** and **list2** into a new file called **biglist**. Type

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cat list1 list2 > biglist

   What this is doing is reading the contents of **list1** and **list2** in turn, then outputing the text to the file **biglist**

   To read the contents of the new file, type

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cat biglist


Redirecting the Input
=====================

We use the ``<`` symbol to redirect the input of a command.

The command ``sort`` alphabetically or numerically sorts a list. Type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sort

Then type in the names of some vegetables. Press :boldcode:`[Return]` after each one.

.. code-block::

   carrot
   beetroot
   artichoke
   ^D (control d to stop)

The output will be

.. code-block::

   artichoke
   beetroot
   carrot

Using ``<`` you can redirect the input to come from a file rather than the keyboard. For example, to sort the list of fruit, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sort < biglist

and the sorted list will be output to the screen.

To output the sorted list to a file, type,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sort < biglist > slist

Use ``cat`` to read the contents of the file slist

Pipes
=====

To see who is on the system with you, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ who

One method to get a sorted list of names is to type,

.. code-block:: bash

   $ who > names.txt
   $ sort < names.txt

This is a bit slow and you have to remember to remove the temporary file called names when you have finished. What you really want to do is connect the output of the ``who`` command directly to the input of the ``sort`` command. This is exactly what pipes do. The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar ``|``

For example, typing

.. code-block:: bash

   $ who | sort

will give the same result as above, but quicker and cleaner.

To find out how many users are logged on, type

.. code-block:: bash

   $ who | wc -l

.. sshexercise:: Exercise 2b

   Using pipes, print all lines of list1 and list2 containing the letter 'p', sort the result, and print to screen.

.. sshsolution ::

   ``$ cat list1 list2 | grep p | sort``
